 # My very first project using Nuxt.js + Vuetify + Vue.js :)

 This project is hosted [here](https://webdev1-projeto1.herokuapp.com/) and you don't need to do the proccess above to use it!

 > Sometimes the project seens to be **laggy and slow**, but remember that all the info displayed is received using requests, so **please** don't blame the technology used :D
